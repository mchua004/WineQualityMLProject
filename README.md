# WineQualityMLProject
What makes a wine good? Is data analytics able to predict what physical-chemical characteristics make a good wine? Our team decided to take this challenge.
A machine learning model for predicting wine quality.

# General approach to the problem
1. The dataset will be cleaned and put into an SQL database.
2. Python will be use to carry out a multivariate linear regression.
3. Finally the wines will be divided into three category: 'good','average','bad'.
4. The data will be deployed by using Heroku and a flask app.
